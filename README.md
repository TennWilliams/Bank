# Banking App
<img src="Screenshot.jpg" width="400" height="400">
This is a banking app where a user can create an account, make a withdraw, make a deposit and see all of their transactions on a flip card. 
## Future improvments 
I would to use usestate to carry the user's balance from deposit to withdraw screens.  Also use a database to store and retrieve users information and balance.

## Run Code
You can run this banking app by cloning it and running it on a local http server.
